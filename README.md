# LogoLab

My lab for creating logos for different projects. The standard process consists of

1. Iteratively build a logo in SVG format (needless to stay: With AI help 😜). Naming the different iterations of the SVG file 01_blabla.svg, 02_xyz.svg and so on.
2. Using diffrent tools (see /tools) to transform the SVG image in whatever is needed by the project. For example there is a tooling to create the image formats & sizes needed for a iOS project.
